# 01 - Dependencies are on US Core. This IG does not comply with US Core. See US Core Ticket FHIR-44842

# 02 - Organization conflicts with US Core Organization Profile on identifier codes. National Provider Identifier (NPI), Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) Number for laboratories, and NAIC Code are not used to identify drug suppliers. See US Core Ticket FHIR-44853
%US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on Organization derive from the core US profile. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process
%US FHIR Usage rules require that all profiles on DocumentReference derive from one of the base US profiles. See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/CGP/US+Core+Variance+Request+Process

# 03 - This is a supplement to the NCI Thesaurus (NCIt) which is in THO. CodeSystem supplements in FHIR don't require registration with the HL7 Terminology organization because they only enhance existing CodeSystems rather than defining new ones. They add localized or context-specific information, such as additional properties or designations, without altering the base CodeSystem. This flexibility allows for tailored implementations without the overhead of global registration.
INFORMATION: CodeSystem/cmc-hierarchy-supplement: CodeSystem: Most code systems defined in HL7 IGs will need to move to THO later during the process. Consider giving this code system a THO URL now (See https://confluence.hl7.org/display/TSMG/Terminology+Play+Book, and/or talk to TSMG)

# 04 - Using UCUM codes like %{WeightToWeight}, %{WeightToVolume}, and %{VolumeToVolume} for drug product specifications offers key advantages: they ensure consistency, reduce errors, meet regulatory requirements (e.g., eCTD, FHIR), simplify data exchange with machine-readable formats, clearly define concentration types (e.g., w/w, w/v, v/v), and support international collaboration by overcoming language and unit barriers. These codes enhance clarity, compliance, and efficiency in pharmaceutical processes, and are not being used in computations.
%UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {WeightToWeight} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked
%UCUM Codes that contain human readable annotations like {tbl} can be misleading (e.g. they are ignored when comparing units). Best Practice is not to depend on annotations in the UCUM code, so this usage should be checked, and the Quantity.unit 'tablets' SHOULD contain the annotation (it does not)

# 05 - These are all inherited from Core Specification.

# 06 - They are inline examples so that they just show in the bundles.  Comes from having to restrict references to be bundled only. The usage is set to inline because the publisher does not support remote reference defined in the bundle.
