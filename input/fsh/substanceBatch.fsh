      CAS: Number Chemical Abstract Service (CAS) Registry Numbers (often referred to as CAS RNs or CAS Numbers) are used to provide identifiers for chemical substances. A CAS Registry Number itself has no inherent chemical significance but provides a way to identify a chemical substance or molecular structure when there are many possible systematic, generic, proprietary or trivial names. [Source: Adapted from CAS.org] Example: CAS [103-90-2]

      UNII: The UNII is a non-proprietary, free, unique, unambiguous, non-semantic, alphanumeric identifier based on a substanceâ€™s molecular structure and/or descriptive information. [Source: http://www.fda.gov/ForIndustry/DataStandards/SubstanceRegistrationSystem-UniqueIngredientIdentifierUNII/]
      Example: 362O9ITL9D
