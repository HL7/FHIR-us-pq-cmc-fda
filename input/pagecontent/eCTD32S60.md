### Bundle Overview
 A description of the container closure systems should be provided, including the identity of materials of construction of each primary packaging component, and their specifications. The specifications should include description and identification (and critical dimensions with drawings, where appropriate). Noncompendial methods (with validation) should be included, 
where appropriate. For nonfunctional secondary packaging components (e.g., those that do not provide additional protection), only a brief description should be provided. For functional secondary packaging components, additional information should be provided. The suitability should be discussed with respect to, for example, choice of materials, protection from moisture and light, compatibility of the materials of construction with the drug substance, including sorption to container and leaching, and/or safety of materials of construction.
