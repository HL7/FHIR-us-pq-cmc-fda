### Domain Overview

The _Substance Control of Materials_ bundle profile provides a mechanism for the industry to submit Module 3 CTD 3.2.S.2.3 folder content to the FDA. This section provides evidence supporting the identity, composition, and origin of the raw materials used in the manufacture of the active substance.

In addition to identifying the raw material by name (e.g., GSRS Preferred, Generic, Common) and UNII, the content includes information such as: quality standard, identification of the source organism for biologically sourced materials, manufacturer, supplier, and as appropriate, evidence demonstrating that the materials meet the standards appropriate for their intended use.

### Implementer Instructions

- Each 32S23 bundle is for a single active substance.
-  All raw materials for one active substance are contained in a single bundle.
- Refer to[ Quality Specification Profile](https://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/FHIR-us-pq-cmc-fda/eCTDSP4151.html)

### Representation in FHIR

The domain concepts of Substance Control of Materials are represented in FHIR in this IG. Below is a high-level FHIR resource mapping to guide the understanding of how the domain concepts are represented using profiles on FHIR Resources. Detail study of the profiles and each of the resources will be needed for developing a deeper understanding of this Substance Control of Materials FHIR Bundle Profile. Concepts that are key to this domain include the following:

### Examples

This example demonstrates a substance with three raw materials. One raw material has a source information backbone element instance. This image displays the narrative as inserted in the composition text element generated by the narrative transform. The XML can be found on the Artifacts page. The XML file with the publisher narrative is on the artifacts page and in the Bundle profile. [ControlMaterialsBundle](Bundle-ControlMaterialsBundle.html)
